# data-driven-ml-textbook
Containing my notes and exercises on Data Driven Science and Engineering by Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz.

## Overview, structure
I will create a folder per section. My goal is to get to section 14, physics-informed machine learning by July 15th.

The accompanying website for the textbook is [here](https://databookuw.com/). 

Planned contents:
- Section 1: Singular Value Decomposition: 1.1-2, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9
- Section 2: Fourier and Wavelet Transforms: 2.1-2.5
- Section 5: Clustering and Classification.
- Section 6: Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
- Section 12: Reduced-Order Models.
- Section 13: Interpolation for Parametric Reduced-Order Models.
- Section 14: Physics-Informed Machine Learning.

The above sections are subject to change; for now sections on control theory is skipped.
