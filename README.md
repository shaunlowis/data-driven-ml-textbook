# data-driven-ml-textbook
Containing my notes and exercises on Data Driven Science and Engineering by Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz.

## Overview, structure
I will create a folder per section. My goal is to get to section 14, physics-informed machine learning by July 15th.

The accompanying website for the textbook is [here](https://databookuw.com/). 

Each folder will contain a markdown file named like: `1-1-overview.md`, referring to the sub-section.
The folders themselves will be named after the chapter headings.
